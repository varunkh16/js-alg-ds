Frequency Counter Pattern
1. Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same.
2. Given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman.

Multiple Pointers Pattern
3. Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist
4. Implement a function called countUniqueValues, which accepts a sorted array, and counts the unique values in the array. There can be negative numbers in the array, but it will always be sorted

Sliding Window Pattern
5. Write a function called maxSubarraySum which accepts an array of integers and a number called n. The function should calculate the maximum sum of n consecutive elements in the array.

Devide and Conquer Pattern
6. Given a sorted array of integers, write a function called search, that accepts a value and returns the index where the value passed to the function is located. If the value is not found, return -1

Recursion

Linear Search
8. Given an array, the simplest way to search for an value is to look at every element in the array and check if it's the value we want.

Binary Search

Bubble Sort
10. A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top!

Selection Sort
11. Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position

Insertion Sort
12. Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted
